# FEFLib
A library for editing 3DS Fire Emblem files.
## What is FEFLib?
FEFLib is a library to assist with editing 3DS Fire Emblem files. The library will handle most game editing operations for future renditions of FEFEditor and 3DSFE Randomizer. At the moment, the library only provides support for Fire Emblem Fates, though support will be expanded to Fire Emblem Awakening and Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia in the future.
